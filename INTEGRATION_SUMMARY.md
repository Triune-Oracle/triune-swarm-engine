## 🚀 Data Flow Architecture

```
CI/CD Event → Automation Adapter → Task Listener → IPFS Storage
     ↓              ↓                    ↓             ↓
Transmutation  →  Event Queue  →  Wallet Verify  →  Constellation
   Logging                                              Update
     ↓              ↓                    ↓             ↓  
React Component ← API Endpoints ← Real-time Events ← Glyph Registry
```
